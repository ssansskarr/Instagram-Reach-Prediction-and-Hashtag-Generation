# Instagram Engagement Prediction and Optimization System

##Problem
The algorithms that power virality on social media platforms like Instagram are ultimately designed by humans — yet to most creators and marketers, they remain a black box. This makes it incredibly difficult to predict what kind of content will perform well. As a result, creators constantly struggle to navigate Instagram’s ever-changing algorithm, often relying on trial and error to optimize reach and engagement. Why can’t we reverse-engineer these patterns and build a system that predicts virality before content is even published?

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end solution that helps Instagram users predict engagement, classify post performance, and generate optimized captions and hashtags. By leveraging machine learning, clustering, and natural language processing techniques, this system empowers users to make data-driven decisions and maximize their Instagram engagement.

## Features
- Engagement Prediction: Predict the reach of future posts based on factors like hashtags, captions, and engagement metrics using regression models.
- Post Performance Classification: Classify posts into high performing, average performing, and low performing categories using K-Means clustering.
- Caption and Hashtag Generation: Generate optimized captions and hashtags for uploaded images using APIs to enhance post engagement.
- User-Friendly Web App: Interact with the system through a Streamlit web application that allows users to input post metrics and upload images.
